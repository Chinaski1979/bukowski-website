    <h4>Quotes by Charles Bukowski</h4>
    <div class="content quotes">  
		  <p>"I would be married, but I'd have no wife, I would be married to a single life."</p>
      <p>“You begin saving the world by saving one man at a time; all else is grandiose romanticism or politics.”</p>
  		<p>"Some people never go crazy, What truly horrible lives 
  		they must live." </p>
      <p>“It was true that I didn’t have much ambition, but there ought to be a place for people without ambition, I mean a better place than the one usually reserved. How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 6:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, shit, piss, brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?”</p>
      <p>“Do you hate people?<br>
      I don't hate them...I just feel better when they're not around.”</p>  
  		<p>"The difference between a democracy and a 
  		dictatorship is that in a democracy you vote first and 
  		take orders later; in a 
  		dictatorship you don't have to waste your time voting."</p>
      <p>“For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us.”</p>
  		<p>"An intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way. 
  		An artist says a hard thing in a simple way."</p>
  		<p>"Genius might be the ability to say a profound
  		thing in a simple way."</p>
      <p>“We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.”</p>
      <p>“That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.” </p>
      <p>“Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I'm not going to make it, but you laugh inside — remembering all the times you've felt that way.” </p>
      <p>“Real loneliness is not necessarily limited to when you are alone.” </p>
      <p>“The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.”</p>
      <p>“I loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches, only writes to, keeps little photographs of.”</p>
      <p>“Find what you love and let it kill you.” </p>
      <p>“Drinking is an emotional thing. It joggles you out of the standardism of everyday life, out of everything being the same. It yanks you out of your body and your mind and throws you against the wall. I have the feeling that drinking is a form of suicide where you're allowed to return to life and begin all over the next day. It's like killing yourself, and then you're reborn. I guess I've lived about ten or fifteen thousand lives now.” </p>
      <p>“there is a loneliness in this world so great that you can see it in the slow movement of the hands of a clock” </p>
      <p>“I stopped looking for a Dream Girl, I just wanted one that wasn't a nightmare.”</p>
      <p>“there is always one woman to save you from another and as that woman saves you she makes ready to destroy”</p>
      <p>“Baby," I said, "I'm a genius but nobody knows it but me.</p>
